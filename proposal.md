# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Metropolitan Mainnet

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project create a two groups that represent a different metropolitan city. In Each group you will be able to join a notiicaion list and see a group objective assigned to a metropolitan area.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My sofware will feature functions, a dictionary to organize the names and contactinformaion of users and a gui to display the soure text in an unique seperate window. The purpose of my function would be to log willing participants in union througout Philadelphia and New york City. In full function the progam would be able to provide a contact list in which notifications and updates could be sent to all logged users using a third party application or auto text. My program will also combine the use of  functions to create a menu for users to choosedifferent actions.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

If i were to combine this final project with the final project of my GenEd elective Race and Poverty In America, the aspect abut improving your neighbordhood trough non profit initiateves and communal organization would relate to the GenEd, whera the use of functions dictionaries and user inputs to solve a problem would relate to the 1051 course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I Was planning to work with Jared Segal but he has withdrew from the course

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my inal project woud be a system that logs the users name and contact information when prompted.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my project is a program that uses functions, and while loops to create a two seperate chat groups and a cobined contact list that can be accessed to send notifications to past users
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of my project is a program incudes producing a gui presenting the users input and the system source code in chat group style on a seperate window. I  would like for there to be a fully functioning menu in the gui for quick access to exit the program.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps include creating a dictionary to log contacts in a group based off of name, phone number, and email address. Skills I wil need to aquire include creating and reffering to dictionaries using while loops, creating a seperate window gui, and ceating a system with a pascode for hidden programabble priveleges that only the coder would know.
